# virti-video-task

Clone this repo and run `npm install` then run `npm start` to start.

If everything goes ok and the project compiles with no errors, a window browser should open automatically, showing the application at localhost:3000. If the window browser does not open by itself, please, open a window browser and go to the aforementioned url.

In the path `src/common/settings` you can find the **initialSettings.ts** file, in which you can find some initial configuration of the app.

The app shows a video and, at some point, some pictures appear in the screen. Moreover and unless the user refreshes the browser, those images must appear only a certain number of times depending on what image is:
    
    -banana: only once
    -game control: up to two times
    -fire: up to three times
